	Generate a random number between -90 and 90 for latitude, assign it to a float variable "lat"
	Generate a random number between -180 and 180 for longitude, assign it to a float variable "lng"
	
	Look at citipy documentation, look for a city near the generated coordinates
	Append found city to a dataframe named city_df
	
	Use OpenWeather API to loop through city_df rows and find needed weather information
