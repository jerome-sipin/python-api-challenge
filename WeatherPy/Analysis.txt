1. There is a high correlation between distance to the equator and high maximum temperatures. In the 
	northern hemisphere chart, the lower the latitude (closer to 0), the higher the temperature. Vice versa for the
	southern hemisphere chart, the higher the latitude (close to 0), the higher the temperature.

2. There seems to be no correlation between latitude and humidity for both hemisheres. There's a slight positive correlation between latitude and
	humidity in the northern hemisphere, but only very slightly. 

3. Similarly, there doesn't seem to be a huge correlation between latitude and wind speed, with both hemispheres having a very slightly negative regression
	line. I'd assume this is because wind speeds depends on geographical features like lakes, mountains, or forests, rather than the latitude of a location.
