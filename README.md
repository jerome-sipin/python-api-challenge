This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the API homework.

For part 1, WeatherPy, I have included my written analysis under the main folder,
in the "Analysis" text document.

For part 2, VacationPy, I have included a screenshot of the final heatmap under
the folder "Heatmap Screenshot" within the VacationPy folder.

I have also added config files for storing API keys. However, they need to
be renamed to the original "api_keys" to work, or you have to rename "api_keys"
to "config" within the Jupyter Notebook code.
