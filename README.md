This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the API homework.

For part 1, WeatherPy, I have included my written analysis under the main folder,
in the "Analysis" text document.

For part 2, VacationPy, I have included a screenshot of the final heatmap under
the folder "Heatmap Screenshot" within the VacationPy folder.
